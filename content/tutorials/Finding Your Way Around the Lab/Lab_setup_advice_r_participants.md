#Setting Up a Lab (according to Luck)
**Why is keeping participants happy crucial?**
It is important to keep subjects awake, happy, and relaxed as it can affect your
data (ex: alpha waves will show up in eeg recordings if participants are tired)
Furthermore, happy and relaxed subjects = larger and more consistent effects in
data leading to less time needed to try to get "clean data" in the long run.
Overall, happy, relaxed, and awake participants = more clean data

**Tips on how to keep subjects happy/relaxed/awake**
1. Talk to participant: while applying electrodes chat with the participant
ask about school, work, etc. - may make participant more likely to cooperate
with you
2. Continue conversing with participant: during breaks continue talking to keep
participant alert and update them on what they did well and what they could
improve on to ensure you have the 'cleanest' data possible
3. Make breaks a considerable time: participants need a break in between
recordings as if they are being recorded for too long they may get tired or
uncomfortable which is not only bad for them but also for our data. Moreover,
breaks that are too long will affect their alertness and too short will make
them bored.
4. Provide snacks and drinks: drinks especially caffeinated drinks and sugary
snacks may be beneficial in keeping participants alert and awake
5. _Optional_ : Back ground music - ask participants to bring their favorite
piece of music to keep them alert -disadvantage: may make participants distracted

**Basic Set-up of an Event Related Potentials (ERP) Lab:**
1. recording chamber: aka experimental room - where participants will be placed
in this room noise should be minimized and room should be set at a cool temperature
as to ensure participants don't sweat because sweat can affect impedance
2. stimulus presenting computer: placed in the experimental room, as the name
suggests this computer will present stimuli to participants (in our case words)
we want to see exactly what the participant is seeing at exactly the time they
are seeing it so it is essential that the computers are communicating with each
other
3. EEG data acquisition system: consists of trigger box, amplifier and an analog to
digital converter connected to the computers - in essence these devices work
together to convert the brain waves collected from the participant through the
electrodes into data that we can analyze into the computer in the control room
4. Communication system: allows you to communicate with participant from the control
room - especially important during data collection
5. Seating: make sure participant is comfortable
6. Lighting: an environment that is too warm will lead to skin potentials which
will ultimately negatively affect data
7. _optional_: electrically isolated chamber: our goal is to minimize as much "noise"
as possible such as the 50-hz noise from electricity running through the walls
disadvantage: these rooms are usually small and too warm leading to skin Potentials
8. minimum channels recommended: 32 channels
9. electrode types: depends on interest of research/experiment - in our case
we use gel electrodes or electrodes that need gel to serve as conductors of electricity
from the scalp to the electrodes
10. EEG lab and ERP lab toolbox: used for data analysis and data collection
