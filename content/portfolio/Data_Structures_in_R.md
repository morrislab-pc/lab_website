# Data Structures in R


1. R’s base data structures can be organised by their dimensionality (1d, 2d, or nd) and whether they are homogeneous (all contents of the same type) or heterogeneous (the contents are of different types).


|    | Homogenous    | Heterogenous |
|----|---------------|--------------|
| 1D | Atomic Vector | List         |
| 2D | Matrix        | Data frame   |
| nD | Array         |              |


2. Vectors vs. Lists
	- All elements of an atomic vector must be the same type, whereas the elements of a list can have different types.

3. There are 4 common types of atomic vectors: logical, integer, double (or numeric), and character.
